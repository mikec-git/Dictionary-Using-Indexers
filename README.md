# Dictionary Project

### Overview
This project was a way for me to apply my understanding of new topics (since the Tic-Tac-Toe game).
Such topics include indexers, exceptions, generics, and improving my code readability. 

### Functionality
For fun, I decided to add several features in the program such as:

1) Searching for words to find definitions
2) Adding or removing a word from the dictionary
3) Editing a word's spelling or definition
4) Seeing all the words in the dictionary

### New Topics Included
To begin developing my algorithms knowledge, I included a QuickSort algorithm to alphabetically
order the dictionary after each word and definition addition.

I purposely did not use lists to practice using generics.
